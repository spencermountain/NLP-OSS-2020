### Typing

i have some theories about why people love typing.
they can wait.

- **typewriter** 
  - underwood no 5 - 1920s
  - nobody liked using typewriters for fun.
    - looks like a torture device
    - punctuation
    - 1 key is missing - hammers were overcrowded - 35-40
- **magnetic typewriter** 
  - IBM selectric 1969
- **insert key**
- [formal-spam]
- [typewriter-computer] timeline
  - letter-writing and corresspondance
  - computers existed for doing math on numbers
  - they both used keyboards

- **add engelbart**
  we remark at how many features it has,
  but not at how little things have changed in 50 years since.
  - herman miller
  - 1963-1968 - 6 years
  - DARPA money - US military
    - mouse, display, light-pen
    - SDS 940 - 60 of the machines were sold.
    - 
  - apollo 8  - launched at the same time
  - borman/lovell/anders

- **SDS 940**

-we still don't have chorded, cockpit desk, or sub-document linking.

### Punctuation

- **keyboard 1**
- **all punctuation**
- **control-characters**
  - **tilde**
  - **at sign**
  - **hash**
  - **astrix**
  - **brackets**
    - particularly worried about backslash symbol
- **ray tomlinson**

  - symbol collision is a real problem
  - DNA sequences were renamed to avoid being classified as a date in ms excel.

- **code-prose timeline**

### Markup

- **Question - write data**
- **wikipedia**
    -[wp as bookshelf] 
      - desipite being inscrutible, people are doing it
      - we have a lot of text. users are trying to collaborate.
    -[visual editor]
      - there has never been an effective wswyg editor
- **Question 2 - markup lang** - how can a user write data?
- **Escaping**
- **Newline morse**
- **margin-love**
- **glimpse**

  [needs work]

### Word-wrap

- **spreadsheet -> text**
  a 2d grid of characters

- **word-wrap**

  a text-editor is not a 2D grid of characters

  [ralf xi, forsith demo]

the problem with text has always been there
we can't turn text into data.

### text editors

- **refactoring - drake**
- **refactor-timeline**

[needs work]

### keyboard focus

- [keyboard focus illustration]
- [browser focus illustration]
- **spicer**
- **zelda**- we can't find what's interactable in a computer
- **cannon-cat**
  it's never clear what you're typing into
  [focus-demo]

- **end**
  - Compromise.cool
  - Theres also money coming in - from time to time.
